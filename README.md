# ChatBot2

main.py:
This is an approach to the design of the knowledge area of a chat bot, the bot goes to Wikipedia to search for a topic, in the current topic the spider counts the most common words in the text corpus and looks for links with the word as content , then it goes to this new Wikipedia topic and the bot repeats the process.
